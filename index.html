        alt="Image of a delicious burger">
        <p>This is the double decker, grand slam cheeseburger that was
            created in a very delicious part of the world. That part of the world?
            It was Idaho. Idago definintely isn't know for their cheeseburger but 
            that's what makes this recipe so great. The burger isn't meant to be good,
            it's meant to be the most delicious mediocre burger anyone has ever had.
        </p>
        <p>The meat comes from some of the best cows you can find on a random piece of farmland
            off in the woods of Idago. Are cows in woods? Who knows? Does being the woods make them more 
            delicious? Probably. But they're gonna get eaten nonetheless.
